Welcome to MathCrypto
=====================

MathCrypto is a library of useful funtions used in cryptography. Do not use this library for improving the security of your application, it is not safe or powerful enough to provide that.

Current version is |release|.

- Math functions
   - Classic number primality check
   - Fermat's primality test
   - Euler's Totient function (Phi)
   - Euclidean algorithm (GCD)
   - Simple number factorization
   - Chinese Remainder Theorem
   - Extended Euclidean Algorithm

Installation
============

MathCrypto is avalaible through Python Package Index (`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_) using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m pip install mathcrypto

To uninstall using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m pip uninstall mathcrypto

Getting Started
===============

.. code-block:: python

   from mathcrypto import MathFunctions, MultiplicativeGroup

   def main():
       print("Playing with math functions")
       print()
       print("Is 137 prime?")
       print(MathFunctions.is_prime(137))
       print("What are the factors of 134?")
       print(MathFunctions.factorize(134))
       print("What is the greatest common divisor of 135 and 186?")
       print(MathFunctions.euclid_gcd(135, 186))
       print("What is the Euler's Totient function of 65?")
       print(MathFunctions.phi(65))
       print()

       print("Playing with multiplicative groups")
       print()
       group = MultiplicativeGroup(13)

       print("Group modulus:")
       print(group.mod)
       print("Group order:")
       print(group.order)
       print("Group elements:")
       print(group.elements)
       print("Group generators:")  # If there are any
       print(group.generators)

   main()

This outputs:
